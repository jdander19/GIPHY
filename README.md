The code works just fine taking out the "gifPic" attr and the gifs are deployed. However adding all the deemed nessicary attr puases the gifs but as many edits as I tried to find the sourced of the error. Both Phil and John M have looked over it and they could not find the issues so currently the gifs appear frozen and can not work but everything else is coded together and works up util that point. I tried spending the last 2 days after submistion was due to see if I could find the error and still have yet to find it.
